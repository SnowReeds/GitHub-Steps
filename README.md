# GitHub-Steps
==============
Steps For GitHub:
=================
Click the + icon next to your username, top-right.
Name your repository hello-world.
Write a short description.
Select Initialize this repository with a README.

Create a Branch:
===============
Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time.

When you create a repository, by default it has one branch with the name master. You could keep working on this branch and have only one, that’s fine. But if you have another feature or idea you want to work on, you can create another branch, starting from master, so that you can leave master in its working state.

When you create a branch, you’re making a copy of the original branch as it was at that point in time (like a photo snapshot). If the original branch changes while you’re working on your new branch, no worries, you can always pull in those updates.

To create a new branch:
=======================
Go to your new repository hello-world.
Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

Make a commit:
==============
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Commits are pretty glorious, because a bunch of them together read like the history of your project.

Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Thanks to these messages, you and others can read through commits and understand what you’ve done and why.

You should still be on the code view for your readme-edits branch, now make some changes!

To commit changes:
==================

Click the README file.
Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write some text, tell a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.

Open a Pull Request:
===================
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you make a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone pull in your contribution - aka merge them into their branch. GitHub’s Pull Request feature allows you to compare the content on two branches. The changes, additions and subtractions, are shown in green and red and called diffs (differences).

As soon as you make a change, you can open a Pull Request. People use Pull Requests to start a discussion about commits (code review) even before the code is finished. This way you can get feedback as you go or help when you’re stuck.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open, as we’re doing here, a Pull Request in your own repository and merge it yourself. It’s a great way to learn to process before working on larger projects.

Create a Pull Request for changes to the README:

Step	Screenshot
================
Click the  Pull Request icon on the sidebar, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.	create pr
Select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original).	branch
Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.	diff
When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.	create-pull
Give your pull request a title and since it relates directly to an open issue, include “fixes #” and the issue number in the title. Write a brief description of your changes.	pr-form
When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

Tip: You can use emoji and drag and drop images and gifs onto comments and Pull Requests.
